## Learning

<a name="learn"></a>

### Do I have to study 12 hours a day to succeed ?

<a name="work-intensity"></a>

Hell no, you'll burn out so quickly.
Keep in mind that you are committing to learn over and over for your whole career. Technologies come and go, the today hot thing might become the trash thing later on. That being said, it's easier to keep learning once you've reached a certain level, but at the beginning it's another story.

You should work on it as much as you want to, but do not push yourself too far. Your brain **need to rest in order to assimilate informations**. Be consistent, even if you're only working one or two hours a day, but do it regularly.

### How to stay motivated during the learning process ?

<a name="motivation-while-learning"></a>

It's a tough one, everyone is motivated by different things. Some peoples like to solve that algorithm with that lightbulb moment, other like to build beautiful things or even automate a really redundant task.
Find **your** thing, then create some challenges for yourself, _I want to able to do this in X weeks/months_. Put daily work session on a calendar or something, and stay consistent. If you can't manage to do it in time, don't worry, push it back, but keep working on it.

Find some online communities, or local ones if you live in a big enough town, to exchange about your doubts, speak code and make friends. By celebrating others success, and sharing yours you'll create for yourself and very nice environnement to evolve in.

Also, don't forget to look back. Whatever happen, you'll become better and better in your domain, look back and see how far you improved since !

### What kind of projects should I build ?

<a name="building-projects"></a>

_Disclaimer: My knowledge is limited to web development, feel free to suggest others projects._

For a very basic project to get my hand dirty I would recommend a simple CRUD projects. (Based on .. Cats ? Racoons ? Up to you !)

If you want to go deeper and don't really feel to decide what kind of design your project should have nor what kind of features you should add, clone an already existing website. Twitter ? Dev.to ? Netflix ?

Here's some "intermediate" features that come to my mind :

Authentification (maybe through third-parties such as Google / Github ?)
Manage different roles within your project (Admins / Regular users)
Try to add some nice transitions effects (if CSS is your thing)

The important part is not to get bored of the project, which decisions about UI/UX tend to do IMO. (Unless that's what you like, then it's totally fine)

## Find a job

<a name="job"></a>

### Will I find a job without a CS degree ?

<a name="job-without-CS-degree"></a>

Definitely. 10 years ago, things were different, but nowadays recruiters will pay more intention to **what you can do** rather than your degree. There's a LOT of very successful developers that don't have a degree and now work in big IT companies.

### When should I start applying for job ?

<a name="applying"></a>

There's no debate : **yesterday**. (Overkill ? Probably ðŸ˜… ) Joking aside, you should start to apply right now.
Affraid that your resume won't even give you an interview ? Scared of screwing up the interview ? These are totally normal fears that we all experienced at some points.

What is the worst thing that could happen ? A rejection. Yes, it hurts, but you'll likely get dozens of them ! You better start to get "rejection proof" early one.

What is the best thing that could happen ? Who knows, maybe you impressed the recruiter and you got an offer ?

What could you extract from these interviews and rejections ? A tons of things : You got experience in the interview process, meaning you can only improve. You got an idea of what recruiters are expecting you to know at your level. You couldn't answer some questions, these are your next learning goal.
Slowly but surely, you'll build experience, and knowledge in order to get a job.

### How can I apply for a job when I have no experiences ?

<a name="no-experiences"></a>

This is where **personnal projects** really shines. When you're learning, you must not just consume some resources, like blog posts, tutorials and videos. You actually need to build something with it, and for two mains reasons :

-   First, as implied before, having made personnal project will build you **experience** that you can show to recruiters. Having one or two projects will really make you stand out.
-   Second, this is one the best way to solidify your skills. You could watch hours and hours of videos, if you never build something with it, it'll never really print into your mind.

### What skills recruiter are looking for ?

<a name="skills-for-recruiters"></a>

When companies are looking for a junior developer, they already know your **hard skills** won't be that high. You don't have to be a coding genius in order to find a role. You'll obviously get asked some technical questions so they can have a taste of what you can do, but what they'll be really looking for is your **soft skills**.
Will you integrate properly in the company ? Are you a kind person ? Are you willing to learn ? All of these are soft skills that are even **more** valuable than the hard skills. You could be the best software engineer ever, if your behaviors don't match what the company expect, you'll never get the job.
Where you could really stand out, is by improving what I would call the **firm skills**. When it come towards writing meaningful and comprehensive documentation, as well as writing helpful tests. I think we could include naming convention, proper code splitting, comments and all. If you can show some interest, or even better a bit of knowledge and awareness about these subjects, you'll nail the interview.

### What if I don't meet the requirements on the job posting ?
